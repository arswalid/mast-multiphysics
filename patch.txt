patch.example_w_agg  is for symmetry along x for the stations
patch2.example_w_agg is for symmetry along x and y (stations and stiffeners)
patch.example_w      is for switching the continuation slover parameters from T to p for a pure mechanical load
patch2.example_w    generation of random values for the dvars
patch3.example_w    frequency constraint enforced at the final temperature without backtracking while loading the panel
patch4.example_w    force symmetry in all axis

patch.example_w_agg2 freq constraints 1- (omega/omega_0) / forced symmetry in both axis
patch2.example_w_agg2 freq constraints (omega_0 - omega)/10^6 / forced symmetry in both axis
